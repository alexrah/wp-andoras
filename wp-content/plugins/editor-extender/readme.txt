2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Once installed, go to Settings then to Editor Extender.
4. Once on the Editor Extender Options page, check each box for the feature you want to install

	4b. Note: if you don't see the new features, then your previous set up was cached, just go, via ftp, to /wp-content/uploads/js_cache and delete the file in there.  Then refresh your browser window and you will see the new features.
